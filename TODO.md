## TODO List for Arcade

* Better front page (or a front page at all).
* Trim out unused CSS.
* Lightbox type support for images. Possibly using Magnific Popup. The code is there it just needs adjusted to work correctly.
* Better management of category links. Possibly use mod_rewrite (to work for both Apache and Nginx).


_Note: This will more than likely be removed in place of the issue tracker. This was an internal list prior to the initial commit._
_Note 2: This is listed in order of planned completion._
